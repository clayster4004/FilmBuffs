# CoreML Tutorial

Hey, thanks for joining! To give a quick introduction, I am going to assume you have a baseline knowledge of Swift, so this tutorial is not going to go over syntactical analysis by any means. This tutorial will be more focused on how to:

- Find data
- Train a model
- Implement it into a preexisting project

*Hint*: If you want to follow along using my app, feel free to fork this repository!

i. Finding Data
In this section you figure out specifically what kind of data you are looking for. You're in luck because I have a couple websites that host TONS of free data for us to use!

Option 1: HuggingFace https://huggingface.co
This option has a bunch of pretrained models as well as datasets for people to train their own models.

Option 2: Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com
Like HuggingFace, Kaggle offers a large variety of pretrained models and free datasets.

Take some time here looking at everything and figuring out what works for you.
